        <i class="bi bi-exclamation-circle-fill"></i> - Deleting your account
        is an irreversible action with significant consequences. By
        proceeding with this step, you acknowledge and accept that all data associated with your account will be
        permanently
        lost. This includes but is not limited to personal information, preferences, settings, and any content you have
        created or uploaded. Please be aware that this process is irrecoverable, and once completed, it cannot be
        undone.
        Take the time to consider the implications before proceeding.
